# Map-the-network
Build an automated map of the network


Work in progress:
The yEd_work.py takes a file named results.csv (format for that file is [device_1,device2,interface_on_device_1,interface_on_device_2] and builds a network map in yEd.  When you open the map all the squares will be sitting on top of one another.  yEd will then organize it all you have to do is go to Layout, and select the topology you want (I suggest tree/balloon)
